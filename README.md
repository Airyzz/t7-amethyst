# What is T7 Amethyst ðŸ”®

T7 Amethyst is a game modification for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3.  
The Steam version of Black Ops 3 is required to be owned and installed for T7x to work. You can get it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/311210/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_III/">here</a>.

## Why Another BOIII Clone?

I just wanted to make a client which suits my own needs, and felt it would be worth sharing somewhere. This is not intended to be a large project, nor will it be frequently updated / maintained. 

### Differences between Amethyst and T7x / Ezz Boiii

- Working Theater Mode
- Fixed `fast_restart` command
